# CSI Intercom Alarm Scheduler

This software is abandoned and no longer maintained.

## About
A small desktop app to schedule an alarm sound to be played 
through the PC's audio playback device. Alarms can be saved
on disk and reloaded at a later date.

This usage of this program was to hookup a PC to an intercom
system via a PA device and play an alarm bell at scheduled
intervals for a production facility.
